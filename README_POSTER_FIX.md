# Movie Recommendation System - Poster Availability Fix

## Problem Solved
The original application had issues with movie posters becoming unavailable after page refresh. This was caused by:
- No caching mechanism
- API rate limiting
- Temporary poster URLs
- Network failures

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Advanced Poster Caching System**
- Added persistent caching using JSON file (`poster_cache.json`)
- Separate tracking of failed poster attempts with timestamps
- Cache validation to ensure URLs are still accessible
- Cache is loaded on application startup
- Posters are cached after first successful fetch
- Cache persists between application restarts

### 2. **Robust Retry Mechanisms**
- **Multiple retry attempts** (3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- **Multiple search strategies** (original title, cleaned title, title without year)
- **Multiple poster sizes** (w500, w342, w185, original) for better reliability
- **URL verification** to ensure posters are actually accessible
- Better timeout handling (15 seconds instead of 10)
- Proper HTTP status code checking
- Fallback to placeholder images when posters fail to load
- More detailed error logging

### 3. **Optimized API Usage**
- Changed poster size from 'original' to 'w500' for better reliability
- Batch poster fetching for recommendations
- Rate limiting with delays between requests
- Periodic cache saving to prevent data loss
- Failed poster tracking to avoid repeated failures

### 4. **Enhanced Cache Management**
- Automatic cache loading on startup
- Periodic cache saving (every 10 new entries)
- Manual cache clearing endpoint
- Cache status monitoring with failed poster counts
- Individual poster refresh endpoint

## New Features

### Cache Management Endpoints
- `POST /cache/clear` - Clear the poster cache
- `GET /cache/status` - Get cache statistics
- `POST /poster/refresh/<movie_title>` - Force refresh a specific movie poster

### Preload Script
- `preload_cache.py` - Pre-populate cache with popular movies (now handles 100 movies)

### Utility Scripts
- `refresh_posters.py` - Manually refresh specific movie posters

## How to Use

### 1. Run the Preload Script (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python preload_cache.py
```
This will pre-populate the cache with posters for the top 50 movies, improving initial performance.

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Monitor Cache Status
Visit `http://localhost:5000/cache/status` to see cache statistics.

### 4. Clear Cache if Needed
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/cache/clear` to clear the cache.

### 5. Refresh Specific Posters (if needed)
```bash
# Refresh a single movie poster
python refresh_posters.py "The Shawshank Redemption"

# Refresh multiple posters from a file
python refresh_posters.py --file movies_to_refresh.txt

# Interactive mode
python refresh_posters.py --interactive
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Poster Display**: Posters will remain available after page refresh
2. **Faster Loading**: Cached posters load instantly
3. **Better Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms ensure something always displays
4. **Reduced API Calls**: Fewer requests to TMDB API
5. **Improved User Experience**: No more missing posters

## Technical Details

### Cache File Location
- `poster_cache.json` - Stores movie title to poster URL mappings

### Poster URL Format
- Uses `w500` size: `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500{poster_path}`
- More reliable than `original` size
- Faster loading times

### Error Handling
- Network timeouts: 15 seconds
- API failures: Fallback to placeholder
- Invalid responses: Graceful degradation

## Troubleshooting

### If Posters Still Don't Load
1. Check cache status: `GET /cache/status`
2. Clear cache: `POST /cache/clear`
3. Restart application
4. Check network connectivity

### If Specific Posters Are Missing
1. Use the refresh script: `python refresh_posters.py "Movie Title"`
2. Check if the movie title matches exactly with your database
3. Try the interactive mode to refresh multiple posters

### If Cache File is Corrupted
1. Delete `poster_cache.json`
2. Restart application
3. Run preload script again

### Advanced Troubleshooting
- **URL Verification**: The system now verifies that poster URLs are actually accessible
- **Multiple Search Strategies**: Tries different variations of movie titles
- **Multiple Poster Sizes**: Attempts different TMDB poster sizes for better reliability
- **Failed Attempt Tracking**: Avoids repeated failures for the same movie

## Performance Improvements

- **First Request**: May take 1-2 seconds per poster (API calls)
- **Subsequent Requests**: Instant loading (cached)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (only URLs stored, not images)
- **Disk Usage**: ~1KB per 100 cached posters
